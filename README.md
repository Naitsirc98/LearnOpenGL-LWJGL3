# LearnOpenGL-LWJGL3
*[OpenGL tutorial by Joey De Vries](https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL) ported to [LWJGL3](https://www.lwjgl.org/)*
#### This is a Java adaptation of the great tutorial by Joey De Vries, available at his [website](https://learnopengl.com).

All the examples are completely written in Java, using LWJGL3, library which provides bindings to GLFW and OpenGL functions, the possibility of natively allocating/freeing resources, debug options and much more.

Thus, the code is very similar to the original in C++. However, I have also modified some parts of the original code to make it more efficient, better-looking, and to follow the Java coding style, always keeping the same results as in the original examples.
